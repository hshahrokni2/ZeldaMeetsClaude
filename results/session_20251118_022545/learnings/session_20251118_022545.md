## Document: 267197_årsredovisning_norrköping_brf_axet_4.pdf

### Characteristics
- File size: 8.58 MB
- Status: Infrastructure test (no actual extraction performed)
- Complexity: Unknown (extraction not executed)

### Agent Performance
- Agents succeeded: 0/19
- Agents failed: 19/19
- Average confidence: 0.00

### Infrastructure Status
- Session management: ✅ Working
- Lock mechanism: ✅ Working
- Logging: ✅ Working
- API clients: ⚠️ Requires configuration

### Issues Encountered
1. API keys not configured - extraction cannot proceed
2. Core extraction logic not yet integrated
3. Sectionization module needs integration
4. Agent execution needs implementation

### Next Steps
1. Configure .env file with API keys:
   - GEMINI_API_KEY (for Gemini 2.0 Flash + 2.5 Pro)
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (for GPT-4o)

2. Integrate extraction-workflow.ts logic
3. Implement agent execution with consensus mechanism
4. Add validation and quality checks

### Cost & Duration
- Total cost: $0.00 (infrastructure test only)
- Duration: 0s
- Tokens used: 0

### Recommendations
- Complete API configuration before next run
- Test with single agent first (financial_agent)
- Implement incremental validation
- Add progress tracking for long extractions
